Accelerometer LED Project by Ying Zhu

This self-motivated control system project controls the LED intensity via a PWM
that is controled by the internal accelerometer values

The accel gives information to the chip the chip then use that to produce a PWM
which is used to control the RGB LED intensity. 

More north more blue, more east more red, green yellow pink etc.
Color mapping can be modified. 
Mixing colors is also fine, northeast makes purple.

RGB LED PWM control module by Ying Zhu	

This module lets you mix colors of RGB LED via a PWM with switches

You can increase and decrease the intensity of each color RGB and mix them into
any color you like by changing the PWM duty cycles via switches, each color
is controled and represented by a 8 bit register, 2hex.

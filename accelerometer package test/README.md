Accelerometer testing and set up template by Ying Zhu

This code is not meant to run but rather as a port mapping template for
Nexys DDR4 Accelerometer. This can be used to set up the accelerometer for any 
project/purpose you may want to use it for, it properly maps the ports of
the chip to the SPI controller, the SPI controller to the accelerometer controller, and the accel 
controller to the accelerometer itself.
